<p><strong>Ottawa</strong><strong>, Canada -- Daniel wanted to go to the school's homecoming dance more than anything he had ever wanted. He had Down syndrome and was sadly rejected by every girl that he asked. On the night of the big dance, his mother walked outside to find an unexpected visitor in their driveway. 
</strong></p>

<p>When most people think of having fun in high school, they remember going to prom and the homecoming dances. Most students dream about finding someone special to share their homecoming dance with. Daniel was like most students. Everyone talked about homecoming constantly, so all he wanted to do was find a date and go to the dance. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, Daniel was not like the other students in one key way. He had Down syndrome. For his entire life, he was stigmatized and made fun of by his peers. His mother, Melinda, tried to soothe his hurt feelings. Despite her explanations, Daniel could not understand why people thought he was different and acted so meanly. </p>

<p>At the start of the school year, Daniel announced that he was going to go to the homecoming dance. Melinda listened as he described how he would have the prettiest date and drive up to the dance in a limousine. He was so excited that she did not want to let him down. She knew how mean other students could be, and she was afraid that no one would be willing to go with him. </p>

<p>While she did not expect anyone to say yes to Daniel, Melinda was in for a pleasant surprise. One of the girls at school, Sara, was friends with Daniel. She thought that kids with disabilities were just the same as anyone else, and she loved talking to Daniel at school. Sara even offered to pick up Daniel on the night of the dance. </p>

<p>Melinda was stunned. After years of comforting Daniel after bullies picked on him, she had not expected another student to be so kind. Melinda was surprised by her incredible gesture. Sara did not see Daniel for his disability. Sara saw the same generous, loving soul in Daniel that Melinda did. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, there was still another problem holding Daniel back. As a single mother, Melinda rarely had any money left over at the end of the month. The costs of homecoming were not in the budget. </p>

<p>Luckily, Sara knew that the family did not have a lot of money. In a tactful manner, she offered to pool some of her money with Melinda's so that they could rent a suit, buy matching corsages and a limo. As a last surprise, Sara even bought a bouquet of flowers to give to Melinda. As Sara told Melinda about her plans, Melinda began to cry. It was impossible for her to tell Sara how much these small gestures meant to her. After so many years of watching Daniel struggle to find friends, Sara's kindness was more than she had ever hoped for. </p>

<p>After Sara left, Melinda went online to send a Facebook message to Sara's mom. She could not repay Sara for her kindness, but she wanted Sara's mom to know what an amazing daughter she had. As she finished sending the message, Melinda began to scroll through her Facebook news feed. Along the side of her screen, she saw an advertisement for an online casino. </p>

<p>At first, Melinda was going to keep scrolling through her news feed. She did not have any money to spare on gambling. Then, she realized that the casino was running a promotion that offered <a href="[CLICK_URL]?utm_campaign={gclid}&variant={variant}&linkpos=Content1" onClick="exit_alert()" target="_blank">200% bonus & 25 free spins</a>. She might not have a lot of money, but free spins were within her price range. </p>

<p>With nothing to lose, Melinda tried her luck at the casino. The first couple of spins went by in a flash. She found herself clicking the button over and over again to see if anything would happen. Melinda was hardly paying attention when she something flashing on the screen. Looking closer, she realized that she had won the progressive jackpot after 33 spins. She jumped up in surprise and knocked over her chair. As she sat down, she realized what this sudden windfall meant to her family. Now, she could give Daniel and Sara the homecoming that they deserved. </p>

<br>

<p>Immediately, Melinda called Sara to tell her not to worry about the cost of homecoming. She arranged for a Rolls Royce to pick the teenagers up. Beforehand, Melinda also took the kids to the store to get the perfect dress and suit. Homecoming would be an unforgettable night for both of them. Even better, Melinda would now have enough money left over to make sure that Daniel could go to college and get the help he needed as a special needs student. The future had suddenly become a lot brighter for the little family. </p>

<p class="figure-caption" id="storyCaption1">Daniel and Sara  had a wonderful time during the night</p>
<br>

<p>It turned out that Daniel wasn't a bad dancer. His mom said, "He loves music. He dances along to online music videos all the time. I bet that Sara didn't know that he was a hoofer." </p>

<p>Sara agreed, "I had no idea that Daniel could dance. I think we danced to every single song. I was so tired by the end of the night. None of the other kids knew that he could shake a leg like that. We even won the spotlight dance. He really surprised me and a lot of other people as well." </p>

<p>Melinda put Daniel's spotlight dance trophy on the living room mantle. Whenever anybody came to visit, Daniel excitedly told them about how much fun he had at his homecoming. He especially enjoyed showing off his trophy. In fact, he even took it with him when he went away to college the next year. </p>

<p>Sara and Daniel have stayed in touch ever since that night. Whenever they are both in their hometown, they get together to go out dancing. "He still loves to get out there and show off his moves, and I still go home tired. What a nice man. It's hard to say what the future holds for us." </p>

<p>Melinda Thompson was certainly one of the biggest winners at the Bethard casino, but she was not the only player to win from <a href="[CLICK_URL]?utm_campaign={gclid}&variant={variant}&linkpos=Content2" onClick="exit_alert()" target="_blank" class="important">100 percent free spins</a>. The casino's promotion began just a month ago, but 1,531 players from across the world have already won money from completely free spins. Since the casino has already paid out more than $2,191,843 in prize winnings, <a href="[CLICK_URL]?utm_campaign={gclid}&variant={variant}&linkpos=Content3" onClick="exit_alert()" target="_blank" class="important">the free spins promotion</a> is expected to end soon. One local journalist decided to try her luck at the Bethard casino, but only won $25.60. According to the journalist, “We can't all win as much as Melinda!”</p>
